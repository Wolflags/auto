"""Platform helpers: a single source of truth for OS-specific facts and paths.

system, so the rest of the codebase can stay platform-agnostic. It is reachable

``import platform`` elsewhere still resolves to the stdlib module). We rely on
``sys``/``os`` here and deliberately do not import the stdlib ``platform``.
